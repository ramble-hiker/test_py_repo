Testing zenhub

So far I have installed the toolbar on github and created a zenhub board for the test github repository.  

I have created a few issues and added a pipeline. 

I have moved the issues across the board and considered the options available.  

You can assign issues to people on the team.

I see how zenhub could help organize the work flow.  You could set up a backlog with issues that need to be accomplished.  You could order them with a priority number.  Then create sprints and move the issues into a sprint.  People could pick or be assigned issues.  When the issues are complete they could be marked as done, and then use a burn down chart or velocity report to check on the progress as the epic/projects progress along a sett timeline.
